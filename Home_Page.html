    <p style="color:white;">Hollow Knight is a side-scrolling RPG that emersises you in the quest of The Knight. You fight bosses that will amaze and terrify you at the same time. Team Cherry developed this game <br>extremely well and used a beautiful art style as well as
        creating a phenomenal sound track. If you've ever wanted to wander an underground bug kingdom and kill release your anger on some bugs, <br>this game is for you. This game is often compared to Dark Souls yet it has a completely different
        astetic and story that works extremely well with the underlaying trap of bosses that are extremely hard. </p>
